    -
- Talked about expressions in scopes
  - What would they look like? Just JavaScript expressions?
  - Will we need to ultimately build our own concept of expressions
    - If so, should that be a separate proposal?
  - How will they work with WASM?
  - Ultimately agreed to split tasks out and make new PRs/Issues to discuss each topic.
- Tobias mentioned that “expressions” probably merits its own proposal at this point So we can hash out details without blocking or slowing down scopes.[https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/99943699732?pwd=RVlFV0JyVnp1MnFqNmVDaXRyMjNHZz09](https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/99943699732?pwd=RVlFV0JyVnp1MnFqNmVDaXRyMjNHZz09)
