## Notes:

- Range mappings proposal (presented by Tobias Koppers)
  - Stage 1 for range mappings!
  - Stage 2 for range mappings!!
- Quick testing update (presented by Jonathan Kuperman)
  - Nicolò: Stack trace validator would be a great place to start writing tests for scopes
  - Agata: This doesn't work very well with browsers, still TODO
  - Artem: Is it ok to also have non-JS files?
  - Jon: It needs some refactoring to have custom _input_ code
- Debug IDs (presented by Jonathan Kuperman)
  - Jon: we need to figure out who to reach out to to expose them in browsers
  - Daniel: Let's wait for when Luca is here
  - Daniel: We should propose an API for browsers
  - Simon: A problem with Error.\* exposed by V8 is that they don't really want to expose it
- How can we resolve x prefixes? (presented by Jonathan Kuperman)
  - We keep deferring this discussion to "later", we probably need to wait for Armin
- Introduction to source maps in vscode (presented by Connor Peet)
  - Interested in "scopes" for renaming variables. Something that would be useful is to have a "parent scope" pointer
  - Holger: the assumption is that the smallest scope that encloses the current scope is the parent. With Simon's PR, scopes are encoded as a tree.
