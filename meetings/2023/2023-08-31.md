## Agenda

- Updates on Holger’s variable name proposal ([https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/37](https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/37))
- Source map performance - has this ship sailed? ([https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/18](https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/18))

Notes:

- Variable name proposal
  - Artem asked about constant folding. Source maps could say
  - Jaroslav mentions that DWARF supports arbitrary expressions
  - Daniel expressed
    - It would be nice if this proposal could subsume the functionality currently in tools like pasta source maps ([https://github.com/bloomberg/pasta-sourcemaps](https://github.com/bloomberg/pasta-sourcemaps))
    - Tools can always pick and choose what information they’d like to use from source maps. We could feasibly add a new feature like this which could result in much larger file sizes but then tools could choose not to include this information
  - Jaro implemented pasta source maps in Chrome (!) if you turn on an experiment. One difference: whether source or generated coordinates are stored. I was thinking of adding variable scopes in pasta source maps. [Lots of technical details of implications]. The inlining tree is represented. I have a prototype generating this full implementation of scopes for variables with Terser and am working on implementing it in DevTools.
  - Holger's version differs a little bit by using generated locations, whereas Jaro uses source locations. Jaro's version works better for how inlining tends to be used.
  - Jaro: In terms of expressive power, all of this is equivalent. In terms of space, we'll have to test empirically.
  - Holger mentions it would also be good to include the type of scope
  - Nicolo asks if it would be possible to encode information about special variables: “In this scope, the value of `this` is which type of value
  - Artem asks if we could allow some special characters like $0 to be able to access the WASM stack from JavaScript. JS expressions using special variable names to access the WASM stack
  - What should this mean for CSS? We should make sure to add some examples. It would be great to get someone with CSS expertise to join the group and weigh in on this
  - What are the main, high-level use cases and goals that we hope to get out of this. What would debuggers gain from this? What about post-hoc tools? Which tools which use which parts of this?
- Performance improvements
  - We would need to prove this would be faster as a binary format
  - Jaro mentioned that DWARF is a binary format and yet lots of times the source maps are larger. These optimizations can be tricky
  - We’d need to measure both size and speed
- Object property name mapping (the one thing missing from Holger’s proposal)
